NAME
    Class::Tiny::Antlers - Moose-like sugar for Class::Tiny

SYNOPSIS
       {
          package Point;
          use Class::Tiny;
          use Class::Tiny::Antlers;
          has x => (is => 'ro');
          has y => (is => 'ro');
       }
   
       {
          package Point3D;
          use Class::Tiny;
          use Class::Tiny::Antlers;
          extends 'Point';
          has z => (is => 'ro');
       }

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Tiny::Antlers provides Moose-like `has`, `extends` and `with`
    keywords for Class::Tiny. (The `with` keyword is implemented by
    Role::Tiny.)

    Class::Tiny doesn't support all Moose's attribute options; `has` should
    throw you an error if you try to do something it doesn't support (like
    triggers or type constraints).

    Class::Tiny::Antlers does however hack in support for `is => 'ro'` and
    Moo-style `is => 'rwp'`, clearers and predicates.

  Export
    By default, Class::Tiny::Antlers exports `has`, `with` and `extends`, and
    also imports strict into its caller. You can optionally also import
    `confess` and warnings:

       use Class::Tiny::Antlers qw( -default confess warnings );
       use Class::Tiny::Antlers qw( -all );   # same thing

    You can put a `no Class::Tiny::Antlers` statement at the end of your class
    definition to wipe the imported functions out of your namespace. (This
    does not unimport strict/warnings though.) To clean up your namespace more
    thoroughly, use something like namespace::sweep.
